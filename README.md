I'm Amirhossein Mohammadi, a self-taught developer & an architecture undergraduate, a "jack-of-all-trades" trying to find my mastery. In my spare time I try to work on open-source projects. Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 on my profile are focused on one thing - **make deploying practical production apps faster & more efficient**!
